This project is a time series forecasting solution for sales prediction. It uses linear regression to model and forecast future sales based on historical sales data. The code preprocesses the data, creates lag features, and visualizes the predictions against actual sales. While the implementation uses linear regression, it follows best practices for time series analysis.




## Key Features

- Time series data preprocessing
- Linear regression for sales forecasting
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual sales
